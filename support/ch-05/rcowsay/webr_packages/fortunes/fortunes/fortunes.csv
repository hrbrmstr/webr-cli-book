Some of us feel that type III sum of squares and so-called ls-means are statistical nonsense which should have been left in SAS.;Brian D. Ripley;NA;s-news;May 1999
"I'm really curious to know why the ""two types"" of sum of squares are called ""Type I"" and ""Type III""! This is a very common misconception, particularly among SAS users who have been fed this nonsense quite often for all their professional lives. Fortunately the reality is much simpler. There is, by any sensible reckoning, only ONE type of sum of squares, and it always represents an improvement sum of squares of the outer (or alternative) model over the inner (or null hypothesis) model. What the SAS highly dubious classification of sums of squares does is to encourage users to concentrate on the null hypothesis model and to forget about the alternative. This is always a very bad idea and not surprisingly it can lead to nonsensical tests, as in the test it provides for main effects ""even in the presence of interactions"", something which beggars definition, let alone belief.";Bill Venables;NA;R-help;November 2000
